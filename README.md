	<ul>
		<li>Search for information about a specific rental unit.</li>
		<li>Register new rental units manually(pending approval with image verification).</li>
		<li>Display entire rental dataset visually on a map.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Arm Vancouverites with new tools to enforce rent control and expand tenant rights.</li>
