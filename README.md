		<li>Display entire rental dataset visually on a map.</li>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>1) This Project is meant to be completed during the Hackathon Event, but eager participants may begin their entries beforehand.</p>
<p>2) This repository is meant as a collective starting point. It currently contains an empty Ruby on Rails project for us to build from.</p>
<p>3) It is not mandatory that Ruby on Rails be used for this project. If you perfer to use Python and Django or any other frameworks, go for it.</p>
<p>4) As described in the Goals, the finished project is expected to:

		<li> Automate scraping to repeat every few hours</li>
		<li> Save up to date rental information into a database</li>
		<li> Create a user interface for data visualization and analysis</li>
		<li> UI must include search functions and must display data on a map</li>
		<li> Allow users to input rental information they are willing to provide</li>
		<li> Verify provided information with pictographic proof. (Photo of reciept or screenshot of e-transfer)</li>
		<li><strong>BONUS:</strong> Automatically tweet alerts when new online rental postings are 4% or higher relative to the price already listed in the database for that address.(#vanRE #RealRentControl)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>5) The finished projects should be open source and as much collaboration as possible is encouraged.</p>
